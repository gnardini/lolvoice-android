# LoL Voice (Beta)

LoL Voice is an app that lets [League of Legends](http://leagueoflegends.com) players keep track of enemies cooldowns via voice recognition.
When an enemy uses a summoner spell, you can let the app know by saying the role and spell used out loud and the app will keep track of it and let you know when it's off cooldown.

## Getting started

- Open the app and select a summoner who is currently on a ranked game, or select Random Summoner to get a random game for testing.
- Champions can be reordered by clicking on them and then on another.
- When an enemy uses a summoner spell, click on the "Speak Now" button. 
- You should hear the "Name Role" message. Say any of the roles (Top, Jungle, Mid/Middle, AD Carry/Marksman or Support).
- If the role is accepted, you should now hear the "Name Spell" message. Supported spells are Flash, Ignite, TP/Teleport, Exhaust, Ghost, Heal, Cleanse and Barrier.
- Wait some time, depending on the spell. The app will let you know 30 seconds before the spell is available by speech.

## TODO list

- Make continuous keyword-activated voice recognition, so that it's not necessary to click on the screen to give input.
- Add other timers like Dragon, Baron, Buffs, etc.
- Add settings to let users decide after how long the app should give the alert (when it's available, 10 seconds before, 30 secs before, etc).
- Check if the enemy is using a specific mastery to lower cooldowns and add a voice command to indicate that an enemy bought distortion boots.
- Make champions draggable on the Current Game screen.
- Improve the apps overall design.
